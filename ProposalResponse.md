# Group 47 - 

## Tentative Rating
Average to Above Average. It isn't technically a difficult idea..but getting it to work well is.

## Comments
 - Proposal too long. Likely too hard?
 - If you do not finish this project, then you will have nothing to show. Are you sure about this?
 - Hardware component will be finicky. Ultrasonic sensors aren't _that_ good. How do you deal with hands moving over the sensor?
