NEVER run apt-get upgrade, it will blow away the kernel that keeps the display running.
To run a script at startup, edit the superscript.sh file in /home/pi/. Currently, it contains:

#!/bin/bash
sleep 22
sudo ifconfig
$SHELL

The sleep delays for 22 seconds, which allows the computer to assign an ip, and ifconfig 
outputs network config information for ssh. To ssh, you need to use the eth0 ip address.
$SHELL keeps the shell open.

To run other stuff, remove the sleep and sudo ifconfig, and write a shell script.
